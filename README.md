# smartpremium-insurance-ml
End-to-end machine learning solution to predict insurance premiums based on customer demographics and policy details. Includes data preprocessing, regression modeling, ML pipelines, experiment tracking with MLflow, and real-time prediction app deployment using Streamlit.

# SmartPremium: Predicting Insurance Costs with Machine Learning

**Objective**
To build and deploy a machine learning model that predicts insurance premium amounts using customer demographics, lifestyle data, and policy details. This helps insurers set data-driven, risk-adjusted pricing.

**Problem Statement**
Insurance companies need to accurately price policies based on risk. This project aims to automate premium estimation using a data-driven approach through regression models.

**Business Use Cases**
Insurance Companies: Optimize pricing models based on customer risk profiles.

Financial Institutions: Estimate risk for products bundled with insurance.

Healthcare Providers: Forecast long-term healthcare costs.

Customer Experience: Deliver real-time, personalized insurance quotes.
